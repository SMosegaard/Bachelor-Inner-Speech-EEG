# About the project
The aim of this project is to investigate to what extent inner speech EEG signal can be classified using convolutional neural networks in a BCI pipeline.

### Data
The project utilizes the open-access dataset consisting of inner speech EEG data (Nieto et al., 2022 - URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01147-2).

### Preprocessing
The preprocessing of the EEG data is done in python, see notebook 'Preprocessing_of_data'.

### CNN Decoding
The pipelines of all CNN classifiers can be found in the notebook 'CNNs'.

### ML Decoding
The results of all CNN model contrasts are compared to benchmark machine learning classifiers. See notebook 'Traditionel_ML_testing'.
